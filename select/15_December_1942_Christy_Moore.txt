It's freezing cold the snow comes down there's ice on the barbed wire
Everything is ready right on time another train is due
Now it's coming down the line it's heading for the fire
Just another December day in 1942
The train is packed with dispossessed people from the ghetto
Treated worse than animals in some cruel filthy zoo
Terrorised and beaten starved into submission
So, it was on that December day in 1942
The train came to a stop to unload its human cargo
Met be demons and by devils and their savage dogs
Curses blows and whips rain down on those exhausted people
But their deadly nightmare had only just begun
And they cried out to the Lord God Creator of the Universe
In our despair we call on you
But all their tears and all their prayers they went unanswered
On that God-forsaken December Day in 1942
Women men and children in that freezing winter twilight
Families torn in two by thugs with sticks and guns
Made to undress driven and naked to the slaughter
And then into the chamber they were forced to run
When the doors were locked and sealed no mercy and no pity
The word came down the line and the orders were carried through
Just another number to add to their statistics
On another God-forsaken day in 1942
And they cried out to the Lord God Creator of the Universe
In our despair we call on you
But all their tears and all their prayers they went unanswered
On that God-forsaken December Day in 1942
