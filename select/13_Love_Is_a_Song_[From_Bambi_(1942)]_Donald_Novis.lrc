[00:11.24] Love is a song that never ends
[00:17.20] Life may be swift and fleeting
[00:23.27] Hope may die yet love's beautiful music
[00:28.36] Comes each day like the dawn
[00:42.36] 
[00:34.38] Love is a song that never ends
[00:39.67] One simple theme repeating
[00:45.53] Like the voice of a heavenly choir
[00:51.30] Love's sweet music flows on
